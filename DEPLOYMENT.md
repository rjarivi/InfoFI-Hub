# Deployment Guide for Jeet.ing Leaderboards

## 🚀 Quick Deployment to Netlify

### 1. Prepare Your Code
```bash
# Make sure all changes are committed
git add .
git commit -m "Hide leaderboards from navigation, ready for production"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Netlify

1. **Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)**
2. **Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"**
3. **Connect your GitHub repository**
4. **Select your repository**: `Infofi Hub`

### 3. Configure Build Settings

In the Netlify dashboard, set these build settings:

```yaml
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: dist
Functions directory: netlify/functions
Node.js version: 18
```

### 4. Deploy

1. **Click "Deploy site"**
2. **Wait for build to complete** (usually 2-3 minutes)
3. **Your site will be live at**: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`

## 🔧 API Testing

### Test Real API Calls

After deployment, test the API:

1. **Visit**: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/leaderboards`
2. **Search for**: `vitalikbuterin` (should show real data)
3. **Search for**: `rjarivi` (should show real data with 0 Yaps)
4. **Search for**: Any other username

### Expected Behavior

- ✅ **Real API data** from Kaito API
- ✅ **Mock data** for Wallchain (API not available)
- ✅ **No navigation menu** access to leaderboards
- ✅ **Direct URL access** still works: `/leaderboards`

## 🎯 Current Status

### ✅ What's Working
- Real Kaito API integration
- Mock data fallback for Wallchain
- Hidden navigation menu
- Direct URL access maintained
- Production-ready deployment

### 🔄 What's Hidden
- Leaderboards link in hamburger menu
- Navigation access to leaderboards
- Still accessible via direct URL

### 📊 API Status
- **Kaito API**: ✅ Working (real data)
- **Wallchain API**: ❌ Not available (mock data)
- **Netlify Functions**: ✅ Working in production

## 🚀 Ready for Production

Your leaderboards are now:
- ✅ **Hidden from navigation** (as requested)
- ✅ **Accessible via direct URL** (`/leaderboards`)
- ✅ **Using real API data** in production
- ✅ **Ready for testing** with real users

When you're ready to make it public, simply uncomment the leaderboards menu item in `src/components/hamburger-menu.tsx`.
